Miloslav Číž (drummyfish):

The files in this repo are actually [webtoon](https://github.com/pithydon/webtoon)
CC0 texture pack, which I keep rewriting with the new textures.

The textures are largely my own work, but a lot of them are taken out of other
CC0 works.

I won't be commiting extremely often in order to not bloat the repo with binary file
changes.
